    "\n",
    "This exercise will be about tomographic reconstruction of noisy data using \n",
    "different filters with filtered backprojection.\n",

    "\n",
    "The exercise consists of two  parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, you need to create both filters, a Ramlak and a Hamming filter.\n",
    "The Hamming filter has a reduced high-frequency response. This assumes that the \n",
    "very high frequencies mostly contain noise. The Hamming filter is defined as : $H(u) = 0.54 + 0.46 \\cos(2 \\pi u)$ with $u$ being \n",
    "the frequencies in Fourier space. It has to be multiplied on top of the usual ramp filter.\n",
    "(The original Hamming function has a minus in it (not a plus), but we have to\n",
    "keep the low frequencies. Therefore, we changed the sign, corresponding to a\n",
    "wrapping.)\n",
    "* Second, you will reconstruct the given noisy sinogram with both reconstruction\n",
    "filter. Compare the reconstructions and their noise standard deviation in \n",
    "corresponding regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to replace the `???` in the code with the required commands."
